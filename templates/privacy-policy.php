            <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how BlueRidge Meds and its affiliates, (collectively, “we,” “our,” “us”, “BlueRidge Meds”), handle your information from the time you access our website, applications, platform, and associated Services. By accessing this website and its associated applications, platform, and/or services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by and comply with the terms set forth herein.

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information processed by us in connection with or as part of your use or interaction with our websites, apps, and us, if we do not have an established patient relationship with you. To establish a patient relationship with us, you must successfully register as and remain a Member.</p>
            <p>If we have an established patient relationship with you, those portions of our websites, apps, and interactions with us that require a username and password or other authentication process to access are not covered by this Policy but instead are covered by a separate HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (“the HIPAA Notice”).

            <p>We reserve the right to revise this Policy at any time. We will make the revised version of this Policy available on our website. The date this Policy was last revised is identified under the title above. By continuing to use and interact with our websites, apps, and us after revisions to this Policy are made available on our website, you accept the revised Policy unless we are required by law to obtain your acceptance some other way. If you disagree with any part of this Policy, or any future revisions to it, please discontinue your use and interaction with our websites, apps, and us.</p>
