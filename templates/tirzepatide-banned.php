                <h2>Breaking News:</h2>
                <h3>Compounded Tirzepatide is no longer available nationwide</h3>
                <h5>[10/02/2024 7:04 pm EDT]</h5>
                <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced that tirzepatide, the active ingredient
                    in name brand medications Mounjaro® and Zepbound®, has been removed from the drug shortage list,
                    which means compounding pharmacies are now prohibited from producing this medication under
                    federal guidelines.</p>
                <p>As a result, BlueRidge Meds can no longer offer access to pharmacies to fulfill compounded tirzepatide
                    prescriptions.</p>
                <p>We understand that this might be concerning, especially for those of you who have relied on this
                    affordable option as part of your weight loss journey.</p>
                <p>We want to reassure you that we are committed to providing a seamless transition and continuing
                    your access to effective treatments.</p>
